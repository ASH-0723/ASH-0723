        " **1.** What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages ?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " *  Interpreted languages execute code line-by-line at runtime (e.g.,\n",
        "Python),\n",
        " *  while compiled languages translate code into machine code before execution (e.g., C, Java).\n",
        "\n",
        "**2.** What is exception handling in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " *  Exception handling in Python manages runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks to prevent program crashes.\n",
        " * The core components of exception handling in Python are:\n",
        "try block:\n",
        "This block contains the code that might potentially raise an exception.\n",
        "except block:\n",
        "If an exception occurs within the try block, the program's control flow jumps to the except block. This block contains the code to handle the specific exception or a general exception. You can specify different except blocks to handle different types of exceptions.\n",
        "else block (optional):\n",
        "This block executes if no exception is raised within the try block. It is useful for code that should only run when the try block completes successfully.\n",
        "finally block (optional):\n",
        "This block executes unconditionally, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup operations, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**3.** What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " *  The finally block executes regardless of whether an exception occurs, ensuring resource cleanup.\n",
        " * The finally block in exception handling ensures that a specific block of code is executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or caught in the try or catch blocks. Its primary purpose is to provide a mechanism for cleanup operations that must always run, such as releasing resources or closing files, ensuring resources are properly managed even when exceptions occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4.** What is logging in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " *  Logging tracks events in your software, recording messages for debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5.** What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " *  The __del__ method is a destructor called when an object is about to be destroyed, used for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6.** What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " *  import imports the entire module, while from ... import imports specific objects/functions directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7.** How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " *  You can handle multiple exceptions by using multiple except blocks or a tuple in a single except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8.** What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " *  It ensures files are properly closed automatically after file operations.\n",
        " * The with statement in Python, when handling files, serves the purpose of simplifying resource management and ensuring that files are properly closed after use, even if errors occur. It achieves this by utilizing the context manager protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9.** What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " *  Multithreading uses multiple threads in a process, sharing memory, while multiprocessing uses separate\n",

        "\n",
        "**10.** What are the advantages of using logging in a program.\n",

        "\n",
        "**12.** What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " *  Use try to wrap code, except to handle errors, else for no error case, and finally for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13.** Why is memory management important in Python.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",

        "**15.** How does Python's garbage collection system work.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",

        "\n",
        "**16.** What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",

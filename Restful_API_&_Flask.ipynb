        "# 1. What is a RESTful API ?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing APIs\n",
        " * that use HTTP requests to access and manipulate data using standard methods such as GET,\n",
        " POST, PUT, and DELETE.\n",
        "\n",
        "#  2. Explain the concept of API specification.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * API specification defines how APIs should behave, including endpoints, request/response\n",
        " formats, and authentication.\n",
        " * It helps ensure consistency and clear communication between API\n",
        " developers and users.\n",

        "#  3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs?\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Flask is a lightweight Python web framework popular for APIs due to its simplicity, flexibility,\n",
        " and minimal setup, making it easy to create RESTful APIs quickly.\n",
        "\n",
        "#  4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Routing in Flask is the process of mapping URLs to functions in your application, allowing\n",
        " different pages or API endpoints to respond to different URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        "#  5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * By importing Flask, initializing the app, defining routes using @app.route, and running\n",

        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",

        "# 8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",

        "# 9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",

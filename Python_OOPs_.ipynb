        " **1**. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        " * OOP is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data and methods.\n",
        " *  It promotes modularity, code reuse, and encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2**. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * A class is a blueprint for creating objects.\n",
        " * It defines a set of attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3**.  What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * An object is an instance of a class.\n",
        " * It represents a real-world entity with state and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4**. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Abstraction hides complexity by showing only essential features, while encapsulation wraps data and\n",
        " methods together to protect them from outside interference.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5**. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Dunder methods are special methods with double underscores, like __init__, __str__, and __repr__, used to\n",
        " define behavior of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6**. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods of another class, promoting code reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7**. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8**. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Encapsulation is achieved using private variables (prefix with _) and public methods to access them.\n",
        "\n",
        "**9**. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * A constructor is a special method __init__ used to initialize objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10**. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * @classmethod takes cls as the first argument, used for class-level operations. @staticmethod doesn't take\n",
        " self or cls.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11**. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Python does not support method overloading directly, but default arguments can be used to achieve similar\n",
        " behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12**. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Method overriding is when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its\n",
        " superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13**. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * The @property decorator turns a method into a read-only property.\n",
        "\n",
        "**14**. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Polymorphism enhances flexibility and scalability by allowing different objects to be treated uniformly.\n",
        "\n",
        "**15**. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * An abstract class is a class with abstract methods that cannot be instantiated directly.\n",
        " * It is defined using the\n",
        " abc module.\n",
        "\n",
        "**16**. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Code reuse, scalability, modularity, and easier debugging and maintenance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**17**. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Class variables are shared across all instances, while instance variables are unique to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**18**. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * Multiple inheritance is when a class inherits from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "**19**. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * __str__ returns a readable string, while __repr__ returns an official string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "**20**. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * super() is used to call methods from a parent class in the subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "**21**. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",
        " * __del__ is a destructor method called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
        "\n",
        "**22**. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "*  @staticmethod doesn't take self or cls, while @classmethod takes cls and can modify class state.\n",

        "**23**. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans:\n",

        "**24**. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
